### Lessons Learned ###
* Asking for help is very awesome!
* I am happy with this project but I had expected too much out of this project. I tried to do quite a big deal at once and it felt slow. In total, this project took a total of 11 days, from February 22nd - March 4th. I did not manage to finish it within a week but I think it was worth the four extra days as I have learned a great deal out of this project. Next project, starting.... after I eat some snacks and when I am mentally ready!
